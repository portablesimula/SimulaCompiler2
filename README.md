# SimulaCompiler

This is a new Simula System created by the
Open Source Project 'Portable Simula Revisited'.

The project was initiated as a response to the lecture
held by James Gosling at the 50th anniversary of Simula
in Oslo on 27th September, 2017.

This Simula System is written in Java and generates java
classfiles directly using the new Class-File API.
